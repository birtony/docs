# Introduction

Orb implements the following specifications: [did:orb](https://trustbloc.github.io/did-method-orb/),
[Activity Anchors](https://trustbloc.github.io/activityanchors/). The did:orb method is based on the
[Sidetree](https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/) specification and Activity Anchors is based on the
[ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/),
[ActivityStreams](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/), and
[Linkset](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpapi-linkset/) specifications.

## Services

A typical Orb domain consists of the following services:

1) [Orb](https://github.com/trustbloc/orb) instance (multiple instances may be running for redundancy scalability)
2) Document database (AWS [DocumentDB](https://aws.amazon.com/documentdb/) or [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/))
3) AMQP message broker ([RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com))
4) [Key Management Service](../kms.html#key-management-system-kms) (Aries KMS)
5) Verifiable Credential Transparency (VCT) ([Google Trillian](https://github.com/google/trillian))
6) [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) (optional)

## Components

The diagram below displays the components that make up the Orb server.

The section below describes a typical DID creation flow that gives an overview of the component interactions.
More detailed descriptions are provided in the various sections of this document.

### DID Creation Flow

Creation and resolution of DIDs involve two REST endpoints: [Operation Writer](sidetree.html#did-operations) and
[DID Resolver](sidetree.html#did-resolution). The Operation Writer endpoint accepts Sidetree operations to create,
update, deactivate and recover DIDs. The DID Resolver endpoint reads the Sidetree operations for a DID suffix and
returns a DID document.

When an operation is posted to the Operation Writer, a message is posted to the AMQP operation queue which is
consumed by the [Batch Writer](batchwriter.html#batch-writer). The Batch Writer stores the operation and cuts a
batch when the maximum batch size is reached or the batch [times out](parameters.html#batch-writer-timeout).
The batch contains the DID operations that were posted since the last batch was cut. The batch is written to
the [Content Addressable Storage](cas.html#content-addressable-storage-cas) (CAS) (which can be in a local storage or
IPFS) and an [AnchorEvent](https://trustbloc.github.io/activityanchors/#anchorevent) is created. The AnchorEvent contains
the DIDs from the batch and a verifiable credential containing a proof from the local server. The verifiable credential
is added to the local [VCT](vct.html#vct). The AnchorEvent is then posted via an [Offer](activitypub.html#offer)
activity to the [Outbox](activitypub.html#outbox-inbox). The Offer activity is stored in the Activities database and an 
HTTP request (signed by [KMS](../kms/index.html#key-management-system-kms)) is sent to the
[Inbox](activitypub.html#outbox-inbox) of one or more services in the [witnesses](activitypub.html#invite-witness) 
collection.

Proofs from witnessing servers are received in the Inbox as [Accept](activitypub.html#offer) 
activities. After the Inbox verifies the [HTTP signature](authentication.html#http-signatures) of the request,
the Accept activity is stored in the Activities database and the
proof is sent to the Anchor Writer. When the AnchorWriter determines that enough proofs have been received 
(according to the [Witness Policy](witnesspolicy.html#witness-policy)), a new AnchorEvent is constructed
with the gathered proofs. The AnchorEvent is written to CAS and the hash of the AnchorEvent is posted to the Observer
queue for processing.

The [Observer](observer.html#observer) consumes the anchor hash from the queue and reads the AnchorEvent (along
with the corresponding Sidetree operations) from CAS, and processes/stores each operation to the Operations
database.

A client sends a request to the DID Resolver endpoint to retrieve the DID document for the created/updated operation.
The DID Resolver endpoint retrieves all operations related to the provided DID suffix from the Operations
database, applies the operations, and returns the DID document.
